### ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment:

* **Frontend:** Vercel or Netlify
* **Backend:** Render or Railway
* **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted)

## üìÖ 2. **Development Timeline (4 Weeks)**

### **Week 1: Planning & Setup**

* [ ] Define requirements and user stories (see below)
* [ ] Set up GitHub repo and branching strategy
* [ ] Initialize React frontend and Node.js backend
* [ ] Connect MongoDB Atlas
* [ ] Implement user authentication (Register/Login + JWT)

### **Week 2: Core Features ‚Äì Focus Timer + Dashboard**

* [ ] Build Pomodoro-based focus timer component
* [ ] Store session data in DB
* [ ] Build user dashboard: session history, total focus time
* [ ] Implement streaks and badges logic

### **Week 3: Gamification + Study Pods**

* [ ] Create leaderboard and gamified progress system
* [ ] Build Study Pods: group creation, join via code
* [ ] Enable real-time updates with Socket.io for group timers

### **Week 4: Polish, Testing & Deployment**

* [ ] Responsive design for all devices
* [ ] Implement form validation (Frontend & Backend)
* [ ] Write unit tests (Jest) + API tests (Postman/Newman)
* [ ] CI/CD integration with Vercel/Render
* [ ] Final testing, bug fixing, and launch

## üë§ 3. **User Roles & Permissions**

### User (Student):

* Register/Login
* Join/create Study Pods
* Start/track focus sessions
* View dashboard analytics
* Compete on leaderboard

### Admin (optional for later):

* View system-wide stats
* Moderate Pods

## ‚úèÔ∏è 4. **User Stories**

1. **As a user**, I want to start a timer that locks in my session, so I can focus without distraction.
2. **As a user**, I want to view my progress over time to stay motivated.
3. **As a user**, I want to join a Study Pod and focus together with others in real-time.
4. **As a user**, I want to earn badges and track streaks.
5. **As a user**, I want to compete with my peers on a leaderboard.

* Weekly stats chart (via chart.js or recharts)
* Streak counter
* Badge display

### üß© Gamification

* XP system: earn points per session
* Leveling: unlock new avatars/themes
* Leaderboard based on XP

### üë• Study Pods (Real-time Collaboration)

# Deployment

## Frontend (Vercel)
1. Push the `client` folder to your GitHub repo.
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and import your repo.
3. Set the project root to `client`.
4. Add a `vercel.json` file to proxy `/api` requests to your Render backend (see `client/vercel.json`).
5. Deploy!

## Backend (Render)
1. Push the `server` folder to your GitHub repo.
2. Go to [Render](https://render.com/) and create a new Web Service.
3. Connect your repo and set the root to `server`.
4. Set environment variables:
   - `MONGO_URI` (from MongoDB Atlas)
   - `JWT_SECRET` (your secret)
5. Use the provided `render.yaml` for configuration.
6. Deploy!

## Environment Variables
- `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secure random string

## URLs
- Frontend: `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app`
- Backend: `https://your-render-backend.onrender.com`

Update the proxy URL in `client/vercel.json` to match your Render backend URL after deployment.

Would you like this converted into a **Notion template**, **GitHub README**, or **PDF format**? Or would you prefer a version optimized for a **portfolio site** with visuals?
